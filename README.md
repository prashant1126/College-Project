The Bus Reservation System is a user-friendly web-based application that enables users to book single seats in buses or cars 
operating on specific routes. The system shows a real-time route map, allowing users to track the location of the vehicle during 
the journey. Users can only book buses or cars that are currently running on their desired route. The platform is designed to 
provide a smooth booking experience while ensuring real-time tracking and data integrity.
